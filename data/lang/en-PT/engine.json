  "tutorial_convo_3_response1": "What's a Sleeping Bag?",
  "tutorial_convo_3_response2": "What's a door?",
  "tutorial_convo_3_speech_1": "A well stocked Tool Cupboard will stop your base from decaying over time, we wouldn't want the place falling apart. It will also stop anyone else building anything nearby. Any more questions?",
  "tutorial_convo_3_speech_2": "A Sleeping Bag lets you respawn if you suffered from an... unfortunate accident. Don't worry about making one for me, we can take turns.",
  "tutorial_convo_3_speech_3": "It's... a door. Did you hit your head? It would keep things out of the shelter, like dangerous animals. Any more questions?",
  "tutorial_convo_3_speech_final": "OK then, you know the drill. If you need help come back and see me, and remember to find more wood if you need it.",
  "tutorial_convo_4": "Nice work, this really feels like a home. I don't know about you but I think all this work has given me an appetite. Maybe it's time we find something to eat?",
  "tutorial_convo_4_1": "That might be so, but I think I heard some clucking from over there. You'll need a spear for hunting and a campfire to cook your prey.",
  "tutorial_convo_4_2": "A spear can be used in melee range or thrown. You can probably handle the chickens without throwing a spear though.",
  "tutorial_convo_4_3": "To cook your food you'll need to insert it into a running campfire. Campfires require a fuel, in this case wood, to run.",
  "tutorial_convo_4_4": "One last thing. You'll need to butcher the chicken once you kill it, you can use your hatchet for that.",
  "tutorial_convo_4_response0": "Any ideas? I can't see any stores around here.",

  "tutorial_convo_5_response2": "You know... mauling. You'll be fine, it doesn't sound like that big of a Bear. Craft the stuff I recommended, you'll be fine.",
  "tutorial_convo_5b": "Wow that Bear got you good, lucky you put down that sleeping bag!",
  "tutorial_convo_5b_response1": "You'll need a Bow, some Arrows and some clothing to protect yourself. Also maybe some bandages in case things go wrong.",
  "tutorial_convo_6": "You're alive? That's great! Surprising, but great!",
  "tutorial_convo_6_response0": "Let's not dwell on it. Now that we're safe, it might be time to think about getting off this island. My leg is badly hurt, you might need to go without me and send back help.",
  "tutorial_convo_6_response0_response0": "How am I supposed to get help? Swim?",
  "tutorial_convo_6_response1": "No, that's too far. Maybe we can make a Kayak out of some junk around here? You'd need a Work Bench as it's a bit more involved than the tools you've been making so far.",
  "tutorial_convo_6_response2": "It should be pretty straightforward, you'll need to make a Furnace, then a Work Bench, then the Kayak and a Paddle.",
  "tutorial_convo_6_response3": "A Furnace will let you turn Metal Ore that you can find in Nodes around here into Metal Fragments, a useful crafting resource.",
  "tutorial_convo_6_response4": "A Work Bench will allow you to craft more complex items. Once you build and deploy it, standing near it will unlock more recipes in the Crafting menu.",
  "tutorial_convo_6_response5": "Good. Remember to come and see me if you have any questions.",
  "tutorial_convo_6_response7": "You can use a Paddle to steer the Kayak. It's also good for bonking any curious sea creatures.",
  "tutorial_convo_7": "OK, looks like you've got everything you need. If you head over to the nearby beach, deploy the Kayak and start paddling, I'm sure you can reach that island in no time!",
  "tutorial_convo_7_response2": "Don't worry about me, with that chicken you cooked and no imminent bear threats I should be fine. The sooner you leave the better though.",
  "tutorial_convo_7_response3": "Do what you did here! Find some shelter, find some resources and start exploring. I'm sure there's some landmarks you could explore like a Lighthouse or Harbor.",
